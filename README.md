## Description

This application is a backend application that acts as an e-commerce backend that uses ORM. Depending on what the user inputs into the request, the response should show products and other things. Also, the user could also use Insomnia to either use GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE requests to manipulate the data. Express.js was used to create API routes and Sequelize was also used to connect to MySQL database.
